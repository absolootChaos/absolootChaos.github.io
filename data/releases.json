Blowing a Horn will automatically Teleport you to Enir Elim, but you must wait for the Item Drop. You can blow the horn at anytime to enter. Be safe and grab a Grace in Enir Elim, who know what lies ahead.\n\nThis is a magic-focused seed:\n• You may only use Incantations or Sorceries\n• Choose only from the first five starting classes\n• One player must specialize in Incants, the other in Sorceries\n\nYou are given Starlight Shards which can be traded with Corhyn and the Twin Maiden Husk for special items.\n\nWeapons are NOT allowed. Use only the spells provided, summons, and Spirit Ashes. Teammates may not use the same Spirit Ashes.\n\nThe O Mother Checker was used for this seed — whether the result is valid or cursed is up to you to discover.\nMessmer IS NOT required this Seed.\n\nMausoleums do not allow summons. Plan accordingly.\nRevered Spirit Ashes are not vanilla anymore. Instead they can only be found in the avaliable 35 Key Item Checks.\n\nAll Incants, Sorceries, Seals, and Staves have 0 requirements.\n\nMore information about the classes can be found on the Github when released.\n\nGood luck.",
